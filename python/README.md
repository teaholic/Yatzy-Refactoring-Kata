Python version of the Yatzy Refactoring Kata
=============================================

Working with Python version 3.9.

In this kata, I
* refactored the class in yatzy1.py to make the method calls consistent to DiceValues thoughout all yatzy Categories,
* proposed an additional refactoring of Yatzy/YatzyGame in yatzy3.py, to maximize the benefit of using typed yatzy Categories. 

I recommend creating a virtual python environment for this project. Then install the dependencies:

    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the tests:

    python -m pytest
